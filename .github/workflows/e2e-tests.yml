          # 2. Add secrets:
          #    - TEST_USER_EMAIL: Email for seeded test user
          #    - TEST_USER_PASSWORD: Password for seeded test user
          #    - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: For direct DB access (if needed)

          # TEST_USER_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.TEST_USER_EMAIL }}
          # TEST_USER_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.TEST_USER_PASSWORD }}
        # Note: playwright.config.ts handles workers, retries, and reporters
