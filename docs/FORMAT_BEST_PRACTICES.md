## Section Headers

### ✅ Best Practice

Use clear, standard section headers that ATS systems can easily identify:

- **Experience** or **Work Experience** or **Professional Experience**
- **Education**
- **Skills** or **Technical Skills**
- **Projects**
- **Summary** or **Professional Summary**

### ❌ Avoid

- Creative or unusual headers (e.g., "My Journey", "What I've Done")
- Graphics or icons instead of text headers
- Section headers embedded in graphics or text boxes
- Merged sections without clear demarcation

### Why It Matters

ATS systems rely on standardized section headers to parse your resume. If the system can't identify your Experience or Skills section, that information may not be included in your candidate profile.

## Resume Length Guidelines

### By Experience Level

| Experience Level | Recommended Length | Rationale |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Student / Recent Graduate** | 1 page | Entry-level candidates should focus on most relevant experiences only |
| **Career Changer** | 1-2 pages | 1 page if less than 2 years total experience; 2 pages acceptable if extensive previous career |
| **Experienced Professional** | 1-2 pages | 2 pages standard for 5+ years experience; 1 page if concise and impactful |

### ✅ Best Practice

- Be concise - every word should add value
- Use bullet points to improve scanability
- Focus on most relevant and recent experiences
- Remove outdated or irrelevant roles

### ❌ Avoid

- 3+ page resumes for entry-level or mid-level roles
- Excessive white space artificially extending length
- Repeating same responsibilities across multiple roles
- Including irrelevant experiences

---

## Contact Information

### ✅ Best Practice

Include at minimum:
- **Email address** (professional, not creative)
- **Phone number**
- **City, State** (full address not required)
- **LinkedIn URL** (optional but recommended)
- **GitHub/Portfolio URL** (for technical roles)

**Example:**
```
Jane Doe
jane.doe@email.com | (555) 123-4567 | New York, NY
linkedin.com/in/janedoe | github.com/janedoe
```

### ❌ Avoid

- No contact information at all
- Only a mailing address without email/phone
- Unprofessional email addresses (e.g., partygirl123@email.com)
- Multiple phone numbers (pick one primary)

---

## Date Formatting

### ✅ Best Practice

**Be consistent** throughout your resume. Choose one format and stick with it:

**Preferred formats:**
- `MM/YYYY - MM/YYYY` (e.g., "01/2020 - 03/2024")
- `Month YYYY - Month YYYY` (e.g., "January 2020 - March 2024")
- `Mon YYYY - Mon YYYY` (e.g., "Jan 2020 - Mar 2024")

**For current roles:**
- `MM/YYYY - Present`
- `January 2020 - Present`

### ❌ Avoid

- Mixing formats (e.g., "Jan 2020" and "03/2021" in the same resume)
- Vague dates (e.g., "Summer 2020", "Recently")
- Year-only for some roles and month-year for others

### Before/After Example

**❌ Before (Inconsistent):**
```
Software Engineer, Tech Corp
January 2022 - March 2024

Intern, Startup Inc
Summer 2021

Teaching Assistant
2019-2020
```

**✅ After (Consistent):**
```
Software Engineer, Tech Corp
01/2022 - 03/2024

Intern, Startup Inc
06/2021 - 08/2021

Teaching Assistant, University
09/2019 - 05/2020
```

## Font and Typography

### ✅ Best Practice

**ATS-friendly fonts:**
- Arial
- Calibri
- Georgia
- Helvetica
- Times New Roman
- Verdana

**Size guidelines:**
- Name/Header: 14-18pt
- Section Headers: 11-14pt
- Body Text: 10-12pt
- Minimum: Never below 10pt

### ❌ Avoid

- Decorative or script fonts (Comic Sans, Brush Script, etc.)
- Fonts that may not be available on all systems
- Font sizes below 10pt (ATS may not parse correctly)
- Multiple fonts in one document
- Excessive styling (multiple colors, heavy italics/underlines)

---

## International vs North American Style

If applying for positions in North America, adapt your resume from international formats:

### ✅ North American Style

- Title: "Resume" (not "Curriculum Vitae" or "CV")
- No photo/headshot
- No date of birth or age
- No marital status
- No nationality (unless relevant for visa status)
- No personal ID numbers
- References: Omit entirely or "Available upon request"

### ❌ International Style (Not Used in North America)

- Photo at the top
- Date of birth: "Born May 15, 1995"
- Personal details: Marital status, nationality
- "Curriculum Vitae" as title
- Full references section with contact details

### Why It Matters

North American hiring practices prioritize skills and experience over personal characteristics. Including personal information (photos, DOB, marital status) can:
1. Cause ATS parsing errors
2. Raise concerns about unconscious bias
3. Signal unfamiliarity with local norms
