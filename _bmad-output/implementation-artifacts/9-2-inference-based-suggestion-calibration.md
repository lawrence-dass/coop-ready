## Story Summary

As a **system**,
I want **to calibrate suggestion intensity and types based on available signals**,
So that **users receive appropriately targeted suggestions without explicit configuration**.

---

## Business Context

Currently, the system generates suggestions at a fixed intensity level. By inferring the appropriate calibration from available signals (ATS score, user experience level, keyword gaps), we can:
- Provide more urgent suggestions to users who need transformation (low ATS scores)
- Give targeted feedback to users with specific gaps (missing keywords)
- Tailor suggestion types to user career stage (students get different advice than experienced professionals)
- Eliminate the need for explicit "optimization level" configuration in onboarding

This improves user experience and increases suggestion acceptance rates.

---

## Design Decision: Inference over Configuration

**Decision:** Do not collect explicit optimization level (Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive) from users.

**Rationale:**
- Users often don't know what they want until they see suggestions
- Accept/reject behavior IS the user's optimization preference expressed through action
- Reduces onboarding friction
- System should be smart enough to infer appropriate calibration

**Signals for Inference:**
| Signal | Source | Inference |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| ATS Score | Calculated in 9.1 | Low score = more suggestions, higher urgency |
| Experience Level | User profile | Student/Career Changer/Experienced = different suggestion types |
| Keyword Gaps | ATS analysis | More gaps = prioritize keyword-focused suggestions |
| Quantification Density | Calculated in 9.1 | Low density = more quantification prompts |

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: ATS Score-Based Intensity
**Given** ATS score is 0-30 (Poor)
**When** suggestions are generated
**Then** suggestion mode is "Transformation"
**And** more suggestions are generated with higher urgency flags
**And** aggressive rewrite suggestions are included

**Test:** Low ATS score (25) → mode "Transformation", urgency "critical" for 60%+ suggestions

---

**Given** ATS score is 30-50 (Fair)
**When** suggestions are generated
**Then** suggestion mode is "Improvement"
**And** moderate volume of suggestions focusing on gaps
**And** balanced urgency distribution

**Test:** Fair ATS score (40) → mode "Improvement", mixed urgencies

---

**Given** ATS score is 50-70 (Good)
**When** suggestions are generated
**Then** suggestion mode is "Optimization"
**And** targeted suggestions for polish
**And** lower urgency, refinement focus

**Test:** Good ATS score (60) → mode "Optimization", mostly "low" urgency suggestions

---

**Given** ATS score is 70+ (Excellent)
**When** suggestions are generated
**Then** suggestion mode is "Validation"
**And** minimal suggestions
**And** feedback emphasizes strengths

**Test:** Excellent ATS score (80) → mode "Validation", 2-3 suggestions max, strength-focused

---

### AC2: Experience Level-Based Types
**Given** user is flagged as "student"
**When** suggestions are generated
**Then** prioritize: quantification for projects, academic framing, GPA guidance
**And** emphasize: skill expansion, project enhancement

**Test:** Student profile → suggestions focus on projects/GPA, increased quantification prompts

---

**Given** user is flagged as "career_changer"
**When** suggestions are generated
**Then** prioritize: skill mapping, transferable language, bridge statements
**And** emphasize: section reordering hints, experience reframing

**Test:** Career changer profile → suggestions include skill mapping, bridge statement prompts

---

**Given** user is flagged as "experienced"
**When** suggestions are generated
**Then** prioritize: leadership language, metric enhancement, scope amplification
**And** emphasize: format polish, conciseness

**Test:** Experienced profile → suggestions focus on leadership, scope, metrics

---

### AC3: Keyword Gap-Based Priority
**Given** 5+ high-priority keywords are missing
**When** suggestions are prioritized
**Then** keyword-focused suggestions are marked as "high" urgency

**Test:** 6 missing keywords → keyword suggestions have "high" urgency

---

**Given** 2-4 keywords are missing
**When** suggestions are prioritized
**Then** keyword suggestions are marked as "medium" urgency

**Test:** 3 missing keywords → keyword suggestions have "medium" urgency

---

**Given** 0-1 keywords are missing
**When** suggestions are prioritized
**Then** focus shifts to other improvement areas

**Test:** 0 missing keywords → no keyword suggestions generated

---

### AC4: Metadata Field Added to Suggestions
**Given** suggestions are generated with inference calibration
**When** they are returned to the UI
**Then** each suggestion includes:
  - `suggestionMode`: "Transformation" | "Improvement" | "Optimization" | "Validation"
  - `inferenceSignals`: { atsScore, experienceLevel, missingKeywords, quantificationDensity }
  - Existing urgency, type, and reasoning fields

**Test:** Suggestion object contains suggestionMode and inferenceSignals fields

## Estimated Effort

**Task 3:** Suggestion Generation Action - ~3-4 hours
**Task 4:** Prompt Updates - ~4-5 hours (5 prompts × cost per prompt)
**Task 5:** UI Components - ~2-3 hours
**Task 6:** Integration Tests - ~2-3 hours

**Remaining:** ~11-15 hours
**Total (completed + remaining):** ~16-20 hours

---

## Notes for Developer

1. **Start with Task 1** - The calibrator is the most critical piece and can be tested independently
2. **Use existing suggestion generation** - Don't refactor it; just wrap it with calibration
3. **Test each experience level** - Student suggestions should look different from experienced suggestions
4. **Consider edge cases:**
   - Very high ATS score (80+) with very low keywords → still validation mode?
   - Very low ATS score (15) with zero keyword gaps → transformation mode still applies
   - Zero suggestions in Validation mode → show strength summary instead
5. **Backwards compatibility** - Old suggestions without metadata should still display (add type guard)
6. **Performance** - Calibration is lightweight (just math), but suggestion generation is the expensive part

---

## Questions for Dev

- Should calibration be recalculated on each suggestion regeneration, or cached?
- Should users be able to override the inferred mode (e.g., "Show me aggressive suggestions anyway")?
- For "Validation" mode with minimal suggestions, should we show a success message instead?
- Should suggestion metadata (mode, signals) be stored in database for analytics?
- Do we want A/B testing instrumentation to measure if inference improves acceptance rates?
