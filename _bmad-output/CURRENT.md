# Session Handoff - 2026-01-24

## Current Focus
Context optimization workflow implementation and session management setup.

## Project State
- **Phase**: Planning/Setup
- **Epic**: Pre-implementation (setting up BMAD workflows)
- **Story**: None - configuring development workflows
- **Last Workflow**: Context optimization (manual)

## Session Summary

### Work Completed
- Created context optimization workflow (`/context-optimize`)
- Sharded architecture.md (868 → 109 line index + 5 shards)
- Created DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md with mermaid diagrams
- Added "When to Load" guidance to project-context.md
- Set up archive folder structure
- Created session-start and session-end workflows

### Decisions Made
- Handoff location: `_bmad-output/CURRENT.md`
- Git state: Capture uncommitted changes with warning
- Session history: Current only (no archive)
- Context budget: 60% target for optimal AI performance

### Files Modified
- `_bmad-output/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` (new)
- `_bmad-output/project-context.md` (added loading guidance)
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` (now index)
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture/*.md` (5 shards)
- `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/context-optimize/*` (new)
- `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/session-start/*` (new)
- `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/session-end/*` (new)
- `initial_docs/session-start.md` (updated)
- `initial_docs/session-end.md` (updated)

## Git State
⚠️ Uncommitted changes - review with `git status`

## Next Session

### Immediate Action
Review created workflows and test `/session-start` and `/session-end` commands.

### Context Needed
- BMAD workflow system uses `/` commands
- Workflows are in `_bmad/bmm/workflows/`
- Handoffs preserve quality across `/clear`

### Reference Files
- Workflow guide: `_bmad-output/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md`
- Context rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`
- Session-end: `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/session-end/workflow.md`
- Session-start: `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/session-start/workflow.md`
