description: Save session state before ending
---

Update `.claude/handoff/CURRENT.md` with:

1. **Current Focus**: What was being worked on
2. **BMAD Status**:
   - Current phase (planning/implementation)
   - Last workflow run
   - Active story (from sprint-status.yaml if exists)
3. **Session Context**:
   - Key decisions made
   - Files modified
   - Any blockers or issues
4. **Notes for Next Session**:
   - Immediate next action
   - Any context needed to continue

Keep it under 50 lines. Reference BMAD artifacts (sprint-status.yaml, story files) rather than duplicating their content.
