description: 'Perform an ADVERSARIAL Senior Developer code review that finds 3-10 specific problems in every story. Challenges everything: code quality, test coverage, architecture compliance, security, performance. NEVER accepts `looks good` - must find minimum issues and can auto-fix with user approval.'

<STOP>
⚠️ THIS WORKFLOW REQUIRES MODEL: opus

DO NOT EXECUTE THIS WORKFLOW DIRECTLY.

You MUST use the Task tool to spawn an Opus agent:

Example:
```
Task(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "opus",
  prompt: "Execute the code-review workflow for Story [X.X]. Load @_bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml and follow it to execute @_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/code-review/workflow.yaml"
)
```

WHY: Opus provides comprehensive analysis and finds 30-50% more issues than Sonnet in a single pass.

DO NOT PROCEED. USE TASK TOOL NOW.
</STOP>
