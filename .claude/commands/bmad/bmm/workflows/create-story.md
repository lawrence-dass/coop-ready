<STOP>
⚠️ THIS WORKFLOW REQUIRES MODEL: haiku

DO NOT EXECUTE THIS WORKFLOW DIRECTLY.

You MUST use the Task tool to spawn a Haiku agent:

Example:
```
Task(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "haiku",
  prompt: "Execute the create-story workflow for Story [X.X]. Load @_bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml and follow it to execute @_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/create-story/workflow.yaml"
)
```

WHY: Haiku provides 70% cost savings for template-filling tasks.

DO NOT PROCEED. USE TASK TOOL NOW.
</STOP>
