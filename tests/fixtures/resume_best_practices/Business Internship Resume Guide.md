Business Internship Resume Guide (Supplement to General Internship Resume Guide)
This guide supplements the General Internship Resume Guide with business-specific advice for various roles in finance, consulting, marketing, HR, operations, and more. It offers domain-specific tips and strategies for optimizing your resume for different company types.

Finance (Investment Banking, Corporate Finance, Accounting)
Finance internships demand professionalism, analytical skill, and attention to detail.

Quantify Your Achievements
Finance recruiters love numbers. Include metrics for everything you've done – size of budgets handled, cost savings, revenue growth, or data volume analyzed. For instance, "Analyzed a $500K portfolio and identified cost reductions of 10%." Using concrete figures conveys scale and impact.

Relevant Skills & Coursework
Mention finance-specific skills and tools:

Excel modeling and financial reporting
Accounting software or Bloomberg/Capital IQ experience
Relevant courses (Finance, Accounting, Economics)
Professional exam progress (CFA Level I or CPA sections)
Tailor to the Finance Role
Investment Banking: Emphasize high achievement, finance club involvement, valuation and analysis projects. Show that you can handle intense workloads and detail (e.g., "Built a DCF model for a case competition, achieving a top-3 finish").

Corporate Finance: Highlight cross-functional teamwork and budgeting experience. For example, "Collaborated with marketing department to develop a business case for new product launch, including ROI analysis."

Accounting: Focus on accuracy and process. Note accounting internships, relevant coursework, and experience with audits or accounting software. Detail-oriented accomplishments (e.g., "Reconciled 100% of accounts with zero errors") stand out.

Pro Tip: Use action verbs that imply analysis and improvement (analyzed, optimized, reduced). Even soft achievements can be framed in numeric terms ("Selected 1 of 2 out of 1,000+ applicants for finance scholarship").

Consulting (Strategy & Management Consulting)
Consulting internships look for leadership, problem-solving skills, and the ability to drive results.

Show Leadership and Drive
Include an "Extracurricular Leadership" section to showcase roles where you led or initiated something. Consulting firms specifically want to see leadership and "entrepreneurial drive" outside of academics.

Use Action Verbs Targeting Consulting Skills
Start each bullet with a strong action verb that highlights:

Leadership (led, organized, mentored)
Problem-solving (solved, analyzed, improved)
Impact (achieved, generated, saved)
Example: "Led a team of 5 to develop a market entry strategy resulting in a 15% revenue growth for a client project."

Quantify Impact
Consulting is "obsessed with quantifying things." Make sure nearly every achievement has numbers—size of team led, percentage improvement, amount of money saved, number of people impacted.

Keep Format and Presentation Conservative
Consulting recruiters favor a clean, classic resume format. Avoid flashy designs, photos, or multiple columns. "The content of your resume should stand out, not its format."

Pro Tip
Make sure your resume "dumbs down" technical or school-specific jargon. Instead of "Developed linear regression model for econ problem set," say "Built a predictive model to forecast industry trends – improved accuracy by 20%."

Marketing (Digital, Product, Brand, Market Research)
Marketing internships value creativity and results-driven approaches.

Demonstrate Marketing Knowledge & Passion
Use keywords like brand strategy, campaign development, social media engagement, SEO, content creation, and market research. For example: "Developed a multi-channel social media campaign to increase brand awareness." Show enthusiasm by mentioning personal projects like blogs or social media management.

Highlight Creative Projects (with Context)
Include class projects or personal initiatives, but always tie creative work to outcomes:

"Created and curated content for Instagram, boosting follower count by 50% in 4 months."
"Developed a marketing strategy for a case study brand, focusing on storytelling and brand messaging."
Use Metrics That Matter
Marketing is metrics-driven. Quantify any increase in engagement, reach, conversion, or sales:

"Increased website traffic by 25% through SEO improvements"
"Boosted email click-through rate from 2% to 5% by A/B testing subject lines"
Show Range of Marketing Skills
Highlight both technical skills and creativity:

Hard skills: Google Analytics, SEO/SEM tools, social media platforms, email marketing software, Adobe Creative Suite
Soft skills: Content creation, writing, event planning, brand storytelling
Pro Tip
Mention familiarity with current industry trends (like social media algorithm changes or emerging platforms). For design-focused roles, consider linking to an online portfolio.

HR and People Ops
Human Resources internships focus on people skills, organization, and confidentiality.

Highlight Relevant Projects and Experience
Draw from projects or roles that involve HR-like skills:

Recruiting: "Organized and led training for 20 new volunteers in campus organization's orientation program"
Training: "Managed recruitment for club events, attracting 50+ attendees through targeted outreach"
Showcase Interpersonal and Communication Skills
Use bullets that reflect strong communication, conflict resolution, and teamwork:

"Mediated conflicts as resident advisor – resolved 95% of incidents without escalation"
"Coordinated weekly newsletters to 300 students as Club Communications Chair"
Use HR Terminology
Include keywords common in HR job postings:

Employee relations, onboarding, performance reviews
Talent acquisition, training & development
HRIS systems (Workday, ADP, etc.)
Confidentiality and Ethics
If you have experience handling confidential data or upholding ethics, note it: "Entrusted with private student data as departmental assistant, maintained 100% confidentiality."

Business Analytics & Operations
Business analytics and operations roles value analytical thinking and process improvement.

Emphasize Analytical Skills with Metrics
Show that your analysis leads to improvements:

"Analyzed sales data to identify process bottlenecks, reducing order processing time by 20%"
"Developed a dashboard to track KPIs, enabling 15% faster weekly report generation"
List Relevant Technical Skills and Tools
Include tools you know well:

Excel (advanced use, pivot tables)
SQL, Tableau or other data visualization
Python/R (if applicable)
ERP systems (SAP, Oracle)
Project management tools
Knowledge of Lean or Six Sigma concepts
Problem-Solving and Initiative
Highlight instances where you identified a problem and solved it:

"Initiated an inventory tracking system for campus food pantry, reducing stockouts by 30%"
"Automated routine data entry tasks, saving team 5 hours weekly"
Use words like optimized, improved, automated, streamlined, reduced cycle time in your bullets.

Show Collaboration and Communication
Include experiences working across departments:

"Collaborated with marketing team to analyze campaign performance data and presented findings to 10+ stakeholders"
"Led a team of 4 in a simulation project to optimize supply chain routes"
Entrepreneurship / Startups
Entrepreneurial experience shows initiative, creativity, and the ability to handle varied responsibilities.

Treat Your Startup Like an Experience
List your role as Founder, Co-Founder, or Owner (even for small campus ventures):

"Founded a campus retail startup; managed product sourcing, marketing, and finances"
Focus on Impact and Metrics
Use numbers and outcomes:

"Developed a mobile app and grew it to ~5,000 users in 8 months with zero marketing budget"
"Secured $10,000 in seed funding through a pitch competition"
"Achieved $50K in sales in first year"
Demonstrate Versatility and Initiative
Emphasize how you "wore multiple hats":

"Handled marketing, customer service, and logistics as founder, demonstrating adaptability in a fast-paced environment"
"Taught myself web development to create company website, saving $2,000 in development costs"
Frame Failures as Learning
Focus on positive outcomes and learning, not failure:

"Founded an e-commerce business; learned hands-on about digital marketing and inventory management while reaching 200+ monthly customers at peak"

Stick to conventional section headers and a clean, one-column format. Avoid tables, text boxes, images, or icons that can confuse ATS software.
