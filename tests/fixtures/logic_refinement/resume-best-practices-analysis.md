## Header Section Patterns

### What Works Well

**Contact Information Layout:**
- Name prominently displayed (larger font, bold)
- Single-line contact format: Email | Phone | LinkedIn | Portfolio/GitHub
- Consistent separator character (pipe `|` most common)

**Effective Examples:**
```
Sample 1: Email | URL | Phone
Sample 4: Phone | Email | Portfolio | LinkedIn | GitHub
Sample 5: Email | Phone | LinkedIn
Sample 6: Email, Phone, LinkedIn (comma-separated)
```

**Best Practice:** Include 3-4 contact methods maximum. For technical roles, include GitHub. For business roles, portfolio optional.

### Patterns to Adopt

1. **Clean single-line format** reduces visual clutter
2. **Professional email** (not displayed in samples but implied)
3. **LinkedIn handle** rather than full URL when space is limited
4. **No physical address** (outdated practice, privacy concerns)

### What to Avoid

- Multiple lines for contact information
- Redundant information (city already implied by education/work)
- Personal photos (ATS cannot parse, bias concerns)

resulting in a 130% increase in tax evaluation efficiency, determining fund tax obligations, 
and identifying over $1 million in potential tax savings opportunities
```

- **Situation/Task:** Tax strategies for banks and mutual funds
- **Action:** Designed innovative strategies
- **Result:** 130% efficiency increase, $1M+ savings identified

**Strong Example (Sample 6):**
```
Designed and tested new firmware features in C, successfully deploying to over 500K cars 
in the S3XY fleet.
```

- **Situation:** Tesla firmware development
- **Action:** Designed and tested features in C

## Anti-Patterns Identified

### Formatting Issues

1. **Inconsistent date formats** (mixing "May 2023" with "Summer 2024")
2. **Excessive categorization** (too many skill categories dilutes focus)
3. **Orphan bullets** (single bullet under a job looks incomplete)

### Content Issues

1. **AI-flagged language:**
   - "Spearheaded" (appears in Samples 3, 4)
   - "Leveraged" (appears in Sample 3)
   - These should be replaced with natural alternatives

2. **Vague bullets without metrics:**
   - "Ensured students were efficiently learning the material" (Sample 3)
   - "Produced an inclusive curriculum" (Sample 3)

3. **Task descriptions vs. achievements:**
   - "Responsible for securing new sponsorships" (tells what, not what was accomplished)
   - Better: "Secured $X in new sponsorships from Y companies"

### Structural Issues

1. **Burying key achievements** deep in bullet lists
2. **Listing skills without evidence** in experience section
3. **Generic company descriptions** that don't add value

---

## Recommendations for ATS Optimizer Implementation

### Quantification Prompts

When analyzing resumes lacking metrics, prompt for:
- "What was the scale/scope?" (users, revenue, team size)
- "What was the before/after?" (percentage improvement)
- "What was the business impact?" (cost savings, time reduction)
- "How does this compare?" (ranking, competition placement)

### Verb Diversification

Maintain running count of verbs used. Flag when:
- Same verb appears 3+ times
- AI-flagged verb detected (leveraged, spearheaded, synergized)
- Weak verbs used (responsible for, worked on, helped with)

### Section Ordering Logic

Based on analysis:
- **Students with strong academics:** Education → Skills → Experience → Projects
- **Students with strong internships:** Experience → Education → Skills → Projects
- **Career changers:** Summary → Skills → Relevant Projects → Experience → Education

### Metric Inference Framework

When explicit metrics unavailable, infer from:
- Company size (Fortune 500 = larger scale impacts)
- Role scope (team lead = team size, manager = budget/headcount)
- Industry benchmarks (typical conversion rates, efficiency gains)
- Duration (longer tenure = more accumulated impact)
